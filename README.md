# Building Games with DragonRuby

ðŸš§ A work in progress! Expect typos, issues, and incompleteness. ðŸš§

An open source book that walks you through how to build games with [DragonRuby Game Toolkit](https://dragonruby.org/toolkit/game).

## Developing

The book is authored and published with [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html). Follow the installation instructions to get the `mdbook` binary installed.

Run `mdbook serve` to boot up the web server that handles compiling everything.

When the code is pushed to the `main` branch on GitHub, an action runs that deploys it to the `gh-pages` branch.

## Publishing

The 3D cover file is generated with https://diybookcovers.com/
