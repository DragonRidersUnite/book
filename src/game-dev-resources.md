# Game Dev Resources

## Assets

Making a game by yourself can seem like a lot when you need to design the game, code it, make the art, create music, and then release it. Luckily there are lots of generous game devs out there who share their assets, from music to sound effects to sprites to 3D models. Whether you're rapidly prototyping and will redo the art later or don't want to deal with it at all, you might be surprised at the great assets out there.
