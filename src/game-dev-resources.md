# Game Dev Resources

While this book covers the technical aspects of programming games with Ruby, there is a lot more to making games than just coding. This bonus chapter includes resources and information to help you make your games your own.

## Tools

Tools for making games that I recommend. Centered around on 2D games, like the book is.

### Audio

- [jsfxr](https://sfxr.me/) — generate sound effects
- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) — audio editor
- [1BitDragon](https://1bitdragon.com/) — intuitive music creation software

### Graphics

- [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) — pixel art tool
- [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) — digital painting tool

## Assets

Making a game by yourself can seem like a lot when you need to design the game, code it, make the art, create music, and then release it. Luckily there are lots of generous game devs out there who share their assets, from music to sound effects to sprites to 3D models. Whether you're rapidly prototyping and will redo the art later or don't want to deal with it at all, you might be surprised at the great assets out there.
