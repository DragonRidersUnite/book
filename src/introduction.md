# Introduction

![cover of Building Games with DragonRuby, with the subtitle 'A comprehensive guide to shipping cross-platform games with ease' by Brett Chalupa and the Dragon Rider Community.](./img/cover.jpg)

üöß _Building Games with DragonRuby_ is a work in progress. Expect typos, issues, and incompleteness. üöß

This book is aimed at new game developers who are interested in learning to code and build games. If you've written code before, especially Ruby, then you'll have a bit of a headstart. But the concepts in this book are beginner friendly. Whether you're new to game dev or just DragonRuby Game Toolkit, you'll have made a finished game by the end of this.

You need no prior experience with programming or game making to follow this book.

## Why Learn How to Make Games

Making games is a total blast. It's challenging but rewarding. They're the sum total of so many creative mediums, _plus_ they're interactive. You'll learn so many different skills by making games:

- Programming and logic
- Rendering images
- Responding to input
- Game design
- Interactive design
- Working with image files
- Editing audio files
- Distributing the game software to users
- Getting feedback from your game and iterating

## About DragonRuby Game Toolkit

[DragonRuby Game Toolkit](https://dragonruby.org/toolkit/game) (DRGTK) is a cross-platform game engine for building 2D games. It lets you write games in Ruby, a wonderfully expressive and approachable language. It allows game developers to quickly iterate on their games and ship them to any modern platform.

DRGTK is **not** a no-code engine. You'll write the code that your game runs. This may seem scary at first, but it's a lot of fun and really powerful. Making games is also a great way to learn how to code! Don't know Ruby? That's okay, this book will teach you what you need to know.

### But it isn't free!

DRGTK costs money, yes. And there are plenty of free game engines out there. But the DRGTK team is committed to sustainably working on the engine and making it the best it can be, which means they need to get paid for their work. Support small teams by buying their software, it shows you're interested and it helps them keep doing what they love.

You're investing in the engine and ecosystem, quite literally, by buying DRGTK. I want to see it succeed, so I bought a license. I want to see it succeed so badly I've written this book to try to help _you_ make games with it.

Plus, if you're a student or in need of financial assistance, the DragonRuby team offers free licenses. [Get in touch with the team to get a free license.](https://dragonruby.org/toolkit/game)

There's also [a free, interactive environment](fiddle.dragonruby.org) you can use to sample DragonRuby GTK. Give it a try and see what you think!

## Why DragonRuby Toolkit

There are more game engines, frameworks, and libraries than I can count on my hands and toes. So why should you use DragonRuby?

That's a legit question. Here are my reasons why:

- It's focused on 2D games, so there's no competing interests in how the tooling works. It means what you need to know is pretty simple and easy to remember.
- It allows building games for all modern platforms, from desktop computers to the web to mobile devices to consoles. It's truly cross-platform and _just works_, which is amazing.
- It's fast a heck, which is important for making quality games.
- It makes use of Ruby, which is a wonderfully productive programming language.
- It doesn't force you to use a specific editor or tooling.
- It's lightweight to run the engine, which is great. Everything runs fast.
- It has live-reload and no compile times, which means when you change your game code, it automatically refreshes in the running engine. This is honestly so amazing, that you wouldn't know it unless you've used other game engines that require you to start a new build with each change.

I'm going to be honest, DRGTK might not be for you. If you want to make 3D games, look elsewhere. Although, if you're new to game development, I wouldn't recommend starting with a 3D game. If you're absolutely not willing to try coding, look elsewhere.

But for everyone else, I think DRGTK will knock your socks off (or at least shift them down a little).

## Mindset

When learning something new, especially something that's challenging, it's important to have the right mindset.

- Be curious: it's the best way to learn!
- Be patient: learning is difficult, but stick with it
- Be kind: to yourself and others

When we learn how to play a new instrument, we learn the basics by covering simplistic pieces of music. Similarly, we're going to "cover" simpler game mechanics to get you started. Before long, you'll grasp the basics and be able to move onto more complex games and mechanics.

Start by making small games that you can finish in a couple of days. Make a lot of small games to learn quickly. Don't get too wrapped up in your dream idea or making something that gets on Steam. Definitely don't try to make an MMORPG. Instead, focus on **shipping** your small games.

What's shipping? Isn't that when you want Mulder and Scully to kiss? No! Get your head out of the gutter you alien-loving freak. (I want to believe! üõ∏) Shipping is when you 1. finish your game and 2. release it for people to play it.

So here's your mindset, really, boiled down: make a small game and ship it for free, then make another small game and ship it for free. Before long, you'll be building a visual novel where Mulder and Scully kiss and be swimming in a pool of cryptocoins! But seriously, what that mindset will do is help you grow as a developer, build an audience, and get your shipping muscle primed and ready for making a better game with each one.

## What We'll Be Making

![screenshot of the finished game of what you'll be making](./img/c09-blue-sky.jpg)

Throughout the book, we'll be building a simple shoot-'em-up where you pilot a dragon. You'll learn all of the foundation aspects of making a game:

- The game loop
- Rendering text
- Rendering sprites and animating them
- Handling input
- Playing sound effects and music
- Polishing your game
- Shipping it!

## Hold the Gosh Dang Phone

"Who the heck are _you_?" you might be shouting at your screen. Little ole me? I'm just the voice of the dragon that lives within all beings! No, no, I kid. I'm Brett! I'm a programmer who enjoys making games and sharing what I've learned along the way.

![pixel avatar of Brett](./img/brett.png)

That's-a-me! If I was a bunch of pixels I guess.

I love Ruby. I've been writing it for over 12 years, and it's such a joy. I also love games. Particularly 2D games. So here we are. ‚ù§Ô∏èüíé + üéÆ = üìï How's that for an equation?!

I don't know, you want me to be serious about why you should listen to me? Oh you skipped this section, okay fine. Wow, did you drop that banana peel there? You trying to take me out already? This early in the book? Well, I'll see you in the next chapter! We'll see who gets the last laugh.

## Why the Book is Free

When I was 16, I took a computer science class in high school. It was my first exposure to programming with a language more complex than HTML and CSS. We programmed in Java. My teacher had us print out our assignments for grading (for some odd reason).

That class was foundational in the course my life would take in the 14 years since. At age 16 I was an emo kid who loved video games. Imagine a swoopy haired teen in their bedroom listening to Bright Eyes while playing _Final Fantasy XII_. That was me.

So naturally, for my final project in that high school computer science class I made a game. You pilot a Moltres from Pokemon who shots fire balls at Zaku mechs from Gundam that fly across the screen. If you get hit by an enemy, it's game over. If you defeat all of the enemies, you win. This game was lovingly titled _Zaku Space Battle_.

![screenshot of Zaku Space Battle showing the Moltres sprite, Zaku sprites, fire ball, and space background](./img/zaku-space-battle.jpg)

In order to make that game, I followed a free online tutorial that laid out the foundations of making a game with Java. There was no way I would have figured out on my own how to make a game at that point without help from a free online tutorial. I had _so_ much fun making that final project that I went to college to study game programming and do programming for my career. I took what I learned in that tutorial, expanded the functionality, and made it my own (with copyright sprites, but still!).

This book is freely accessible so that someone who loves games and wants to try making them can do so. Free programming resources have truly shaped my life and career. I wouldn't have the life and career I have now without them. So I want to give back and try to help other aspiring developers.

You'll learn the foundations of game programming and making games, as well as some more advanced topics. If this book can help even just one person start and finish a game, it's worth every minute I've spent on it. We'll make a game not too dissimilar from _Zaku Space Battle_. Once you finish it, take what you've learned and make it your own!
