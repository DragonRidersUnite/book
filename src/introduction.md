# Introduction

ðŸš§ _Building Games with DragonRuby_ is a work in progress. ðŸš§

This book is aimed at new game developers who are interested in learning to code and build games. If you've written code before, especially Ruby, then you'll have a bit of a headstart. But the concepts in this book are beginner friendly.

You need no prior experience with programming or game making to follow this book.

## Why Learn How to Make Games

Making games is a total blast. It's challenging but rewarding. They're the sum total of so many creative mediums, _plus_ their interactive. You'll learn so many different skills by making games:

- Programming and logic
- Rendering images
- Responding to input
- Game design
- Working with image files
- Editing audio files
- Distributing the game software to users
- Getting feedback from your game

## About DragonRuby Game Toolkit

[DragonRuby Game Toolkit](https://dragonruby.org/toolkit/game) (DRGTK) is a cross-platform game engine for building 2D games. It lets you write games in Ruby, a wonderfully expressive and approachable language. It allows game developers to quickly iterate on their games and ship them to any modern platform.

DRGTK is not a no-code engine. You'll write the code that your game runs. This may seem scary at first, but it's a lot of fun and really powerful. Making games is also a great way to learn how to code! Don't know Ruby? That's okay, this book will teach you what you need to know.
